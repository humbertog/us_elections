# US presidential elections regression analysis


Is there a relation between the socioeconomic variables of the population (by county) and the results of the 2008, 2012 and 2016 U.S. presidential elections?

I fit 2 logistic models: more can be found in http://rpubs.com/humbertog/us_presidential_elections
